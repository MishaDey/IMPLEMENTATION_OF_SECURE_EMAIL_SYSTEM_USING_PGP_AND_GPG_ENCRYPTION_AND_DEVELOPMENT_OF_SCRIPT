    "# **PYTHON SCRIPT TO SEND EMAIL USING SMTP**\n",
    "Sending a encrypted email through python can be done using **email package** ( library for managing email messages) and **smtplib** (more details below).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **LIBRARIES,MODULES AND PACKAGES USED :**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.smtplib - SMTP Protocol Client :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Smtplib ,an library or a module that defines an SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer protocol)client session object which can be used to send any email to any other internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. ssl - Secure Socket Layer :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provide security to the data that is transferred between web browser and server. SSL encrypt the link between a web server and a browser which ensures that all data passed between them remain private and free from attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Email Package :**\n",
    "The email package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and other RFC 2822-based message documents. It is specifically not designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP (RFC 2821), NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as smtplib and nntplib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions :**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.\n",
    "\n",
    " **MimeMultipart** type is one which represents a document that's comprised of multiple component parts, each of which may have its own individual MIME type.If a message has a multipart Content-Type, that means it consists of multiple messages and each of them defines its own Content-Type (which can again be multipart or something else). \n",
    "\n",
    " **MimeBase** is  the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of Message. \n",
    "\n",
    "  **MIMEText** class is used to create MIME objects of major type text.\n",
    " The email package provides some convenient encodings in its encoders module. These encoders are actually used by the MIMEAudio and MIMEImage class constructors to provide default encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. getpass - Portable Password input :**\n",
    "\n",
    "The getpass module provides a portable way to handle such password prompts securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
